# Advent of Code 2025 in Rust btw

🎄 Welcome to the Advent of Code 2025 repository! 🎁

This repository contains solutions and code for the Advent of Code 2025 challenges. Advent of Code is an annual coding
event with daily programming puzzles throughout the month of December. It's a great opportunity to enhance your coding
skills, explore new programming languages, and join a global community of developers in the festive spirit of
problem-solving.

## Structure

- Solution: Each day has its own file e.g., `day01.rs`, `day02.rs` it (usually) contains solution for part 1 and part 2 of each
  challenge.
- Input: Each day has its own personalized input file in the `assets` folder: `input` 
- Tests: (hopefully) all solutions include test cases - to run use `cargo test`
